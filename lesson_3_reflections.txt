When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with various teams.
    When you wish to share your work with the open source community.
    For safe storage - in case your laptop fails.
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not wish to automatically pull all the contributions from 
    other engineers - most likely you'd want to manually select them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: used to clone a repository on GitHub only.
    Clones: used to copy a repository either from GitHub to your local drive, 
    	or from within your local drive.
    Branches: used create another workstream based from an existing branch (i.e., master)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is beneficial because you can perform a git diff even when you're offline.
    You can know exactly how many more commits have been made when you log back on.
